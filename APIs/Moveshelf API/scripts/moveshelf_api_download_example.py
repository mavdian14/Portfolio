## Readme
# The datastructure of Moveshelf is organized as follows:
# * Project: Projects are the highest level and associated to a single organization in Moveshelf.
# * Subjects: Each project contains a list of subjects. At project level, access to the Electronic Health Record (EHR) of a subject can be made.
# * Sessions: A session contains the relevant information for a specific measurement session and is typically defined by the date of the measurement.
# * Conditions: Conditions specify a group of trials that were performed within a session.
# * Trials: Trials, aka clips, are containers used to store our data. It consists of metadata and 'Additional Data', where the actual data of a trial is stored.

# Projects, Subjects and sessions are defined by their ID. When uploading data, a clip id is needed, which can be generated for new trial/clip, or obtained from the existing clips. Using this id, additional data can be uploaded using the provided upload url.
#
# For the data to be uploaded, the type needs to be specified. Within Moveshelf, we support the following data types (to be specified in the upload):
# * video: .mp4, .mov, .mpg, .avi
# * motion: .bvh, .fbx, .trc, .glb, .mox, c3d, xlsx
# * doc: .pdf
# * data: .csv, .json, .txt
# * img: .png, .jpg
# * camera: .xcp
# * raw: anything not specified above

# To access the API, you need an API key (the API key can be obtained from your account settings in Moveshelf or was provided to you beforehand. Make sure your API key ('mvshlf-api-key.json') is stored in the root folder of this project
# If needed, you can point the API to a specific location (e.g. staging) in mvshlf-config.json.


## Specify the details of your data to be uploaded and where it should go
